# Foody Project

## What is this project about?
This is a social-network-like microservice project to improve myself, try and train
new technologies according to current trends.

Foody will handle restaurants and their menus by treating foods as
objects which live independently. This way users will be writing
guides (or comments) for a specific food from a specific menu
from a restaurant. Or they can write guides & comments for a restaurant.

Guide is a whole different feature, but I want to include it for some
challenge for now.

## What am I going to do iteratively?
1. Build an application using basic and common microservice standards (V1):
   1. Eureka server, feign client & gateway
   2. Config Server (Classpath)
   3. PostgreSql (JDBC)
   4. Docker
   5. JUnit
   6. Error handling
   7. Spring Security (HttpSession)
2. Next I will add some technologies (V2):
   1. Kafka
   2. ELK Stack
   3. Config Server (Git)
   4. MongoDB, Redis
   4. Guide, comments & other social interactions
   5. Spring Security (JWT Token)
3. Next I will change some technologies (V3):
   1. gRPC for communication between MS.
   2. Config Server (Vault)
   3. Kubernetes
   4. Monitoring tools (idk)
   5. Deployment (Jenkins)
   6. Spring Security (Spring session)

This way I think I will improve my microservice knowledge from basic level to
intermediate or advanced level.
